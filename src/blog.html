                This was the first allocated time slot in our timetables for the group project.
                We were introduced to each other for the first time and we were asked to carry
                out team building exercises, such as making the tallest tower possible with scrap
                materials and playing two truths and one lie. This established good relationships
                for the group and in turn created a well dynamic in the group. We came to the
                conclusion that we would have bi-weekly meetings where we can meet and update
                the group on any progression or issues. We decided that the initial meet up would
                be to delegate work and set tasks and the second meet up was to consolidate what
                work had been completed.

                This was the first submission deadline. We had to create a ‘design alliance’ which
                stated what everyone’s intentions were and how they aimed to behave throughout the
                group process. This was also paired alongside a reflection report for the kick-off,
                which was our first meet up, a few days prior. We had to consolidate everything
                we discussed in the initial meeting and agree on a common understanding as to
                how we wanted this group to work well together.

                We had an upcoming submission deadline – the pitch for our game – and we needed
                to come up with ideas for our game. We met up and selected one team member to
                be the team leader, their role was to ensure any admin tasks were dealt with, such
                as booking library rooms, and delegate roles to individuals whilst mediating the
                teamwork and manage disputes if any were to arise. We also selected one team member
                to be the ‘note taker’ and would add to the development blog after each group meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we spoke about our group’s individual strengths and weaknesses to
                delegate different areas of work to different people. This was to ensure we result
                in very high-quality work, as people would utilise their strengths. We decided on
                two team members with good presentation skills to be the faces of the pitch, and
                the group worked collaboratively on creating a script. The pitch was filmed and
                submitted successfully.

            <p>
                We had another meeting to begin our work for the third submission on the 10th of
                November, which includes The Hack, the Project Website, the Game Design Document
                and the Software Quality Strategy Report. We decided to get the team members to
                put themselves up for specific roles and the section they favoured the most. This
                was to ensure people worked on what they wanted to. Anything that wasn’t selected
                was split up and distributed between the group. We created four teams, one for each
                submission task. A spreadsheet was created breaking up each task into individuals’
                steps and this was done to ensure we have good time management and to make sure every
                single task was completed successfully. We utilised the application ‘Trello’ to track
                all the task progression.
            </p>
            <p>
                We met up twice a week till our deadline to maintain the good standard and prepare
                ourselves for the submission date.

                The next submission we had was the Minimal Viable Product and the Project
                Website and Development Blog. This was for the 12th of December 2019. This
                submission was split into two different subsections; the coding and the
                website. We decided to meet up and designate different roles to different
                members in the group, three members focused on finalising the game mechanics,
                two members focused on the website and making it look professional and informative,
                two members focused on getting the sound and graphics completed on the game,
                and one member on the development website.
            </p>
            <p>
                This submission was a difficult one for the team due to the time constraints. We
                needed to complete a large number of tasks in a short duration of time, with the
                additional stress of completing work for the other modules simultaneously. This
                aspect of multi-tasking and prioritising tasks was difficult for us all to grasp.
                We overcame this issue by scheduling meetings early in the morning to discuss what
                needed to be done and allowing the team to go off independently and do their own
                thing. This worked well for us as we all managed to complete our individual roles in time.
