                This was the first allocated time slot in our timetables for the group project.
                We were introduced to each other for the first time and we were asked to carry
                out team building exercises, such as making the tallest tower possible with scrap
                materials and playing two truths and one lie. This established good relationships
                for the group and in turn created a well dynamic in the group. We came to the
                conclusion that we would have bi-weekly meetings where we can meet and update
                the group on any progression or issues. We decided that the initial meet up would
                be to delegate work and set tasks and the second meet up was to consolidate what
                work had been completed.

                This was the first submission deadline. We had to create a design alliance which
                stated what everyones intentions were and how they aimed to behave throughout the
                group process. This was also paired alongside a reflection report for the kick-off,
                which was our first meet up, a few days prior. We had to consolidate everything
                we discussed in the initial meeting and agree on a common understanding as to
                how we wanted this group to work well together.

                We had an upcoming submission deadline: the pitch for our game, and we needed
                to come up with ideas for our game. We met up and selected one team member to
                be the team leader, their role was to ensure any admin tasks were dealt with, such
                as booking library rooms, and delegate roles to individuals whilst mediating the
                teamwork and manage disputes if any were to arise. We also selected one team member
                to be the note taker and would add to the development blog after each group meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we spoke about our groups individual strengths and weaknesses to
                delegate different areas of work to different people. This was to ensure we result
                in very high-quality work, as people would utilise their strengths. We decided on
                two team members with good presentation skills to be the faces of the pitch, and
                the group worked collaboratively on creating a script. The pitch was filmed and
                submitted successfully.

                We had another meeting to begin our work for the third submission on the 10th of
                November, which includes The Hack, the Project Website, the Game Design Document
                and the Software Quality Strategy Report. We decided to get the team members to
                put themselves up for specific roles and the section they favoured the most. This
                was to ensure people worked on what they wanted to. Anything that was not selected
                was split up and distributed between the group. We created four teams, one for each
                submission task. A spreadsheet was created breaking up each task into individuals
                steps and this was done to ensure we have good time management and to make sure every
                single task was completed successfully. We utilised the application Trello to track
                all the task progression.
            </p>
            <p>
                We met up twice a week till our deadline to maintain the good standard and prepare
                ourselves for the submission date.

                The next submission we had was the Minimal Viable Product and the Project
                Website and Development Blog. This was for the 12th of December 2019. This
                submission was split into two different subsections; the coding and the
                website. We decided to meet up and designate different roles to different
                members in the group, three members focused on finalising the game mechanics,
                two members focused on the website and making it look professional and informative,
                two members focused on getting the sound and graphics completed on the game,
                and one member on the development website.
            </p>
            <p>
                This submission was a difficult one for the team due to the time constraints. We
                needed to complete a large number of tasks in a short duration of time, with the
                additional stress of completing work for the other modules simultaneously. This
                aspect of multi-tasking and prioritising tasks was difficult for us all to grasp.
                We overcame this issue by scheduling meetings early in the morning to discuss what
                needed to be done and allowing the team to go off independently and do their own
                thing. This worked well for us as we all managed to complete our individual roles in time.

                We continued to work towards our next submission, which was the: MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT.
                This was a small less complex version of our final product; it should contain all the core 
                functionalities of the game and have complete working parts for the end-user.
                This MVP submission also included a up-to-date development blog alongside a fully working website.
            </p>
            <p>
                We split our team into three different groups: those working on the game itself, 
                those working on the website and those working on the presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                This meant that we had to utilise our GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT that we had produced
                for the previous submission task and construct our MVP through the use our HACK.
                Our hack was successful therefore in order to create the MVP was fairly simple as
                we had a base which we simply needed to adapt and add to. The game design document
                consisted of every feature we planned to execute in our final game and as the MVP
                is meant to contain the core functionalities of the game, we decided to pick the
                main components and implement that into our updated game.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MVP submission was a presentation and in order to prepare, two of our group
                members had to come up with a script and plan a live demonstration of our game.

                We had a scheduled lecture with Peter. The purpose of the lecture was to get
                us to reflect on our team.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were instructed to focus on the positives of our team and the steps we take
                which are sucessful and are beneficial to the teams progess. We drew out a ship
                and above the ship were the positives which helped the sails move forward. We
                recognised our commitment, leadership and attitude towards one another was what
                allowed us to succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                When looking at our downfall; the areas in which we found we were weighing our
                boat down was our like of time management, attitude towards the tasks and our
                lack of organisation. These steps discouraged us to work to our best abilities
                and simultaneously led to poor and low quaity work.
            </p>
            <p>
                We finally reflected back on what we would do differently and how we could
                avoid any of the negative steps we had taken in the past and came up with
                steps we could take from this moment forward to increase momentum in our
                progress. These steps included, setting regular meetings every week with
                both the subteams and the entire team, establishing timely goals to ensure
                the final deadline would be completed sucessfully, and encourage more team
                communication throughout.

                The next deadline we had was the SCREENCAST task. 
                
                This task involves a screencast that demonstrates the software running.
                It should be targeted at your target users/players and be no longer than 15 minutes.
                It should be narrated, to explain what is being shown.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, in order to complete this task, we had to split the team, yet again,
                into subgroups. This was to ensure each section of the task was completed to a high 
                standard. We scheduled in multiple DISCORD meetings in which we were able to delegate
                roles and update the group on the individual progess.
            </p>
            <p>
                We set up a meeting in which we identified the positives of our game so far, the ways
                we could improve our game now, and the issues we faced alongside the solutions on how 
                we would fix it. This task was very useful as it allowed us to identify key points of
                our game that needed attending to and additionally highlight the areas which we had 
                successfully completed.
