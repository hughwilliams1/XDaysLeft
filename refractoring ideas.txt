cards should automatically be displayed
i.e. when a card is created it should be displayed depending on where it is in the hand
hand should have predetermined locations

card game manager sorts out hand
user extend player and has a the deck
playstate has playing cards
deck isnt actually used at the moment just manually add cards

we have a different play state and card game manager for each level


how do i want deck to work
player to draw to from deck
deck to be a collection of all the players/enemies cards
how am i going to make what inside deck
maybe consider having an enemy deck and a player deck

enemy deck
predetermined
dont need a add/remove card can just send in an array

player deck
can be changed

card reader could be split into card reader and cards/cardList
